## Initialize the database

To start, initialize the database. What I did was (not sure if right, let me know if there's a proper way of doing this):

1. Go to phpMyAdmin
2. Click on new in the left sidebar
3. Click on "SQL" under your server:localhost:3306 (if your mysql port is 3306)
4. Copy-paste in initauthdb.sql and click "Go"
    - Maybe we can actually use this file to initialize all tables? Or we can just do SQL statements in the actual code?

## Run the code
If you open the files through localhost or 127.0.0.1 or whatever it should work now.
